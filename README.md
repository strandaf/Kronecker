# Kronecker

Some code for computing Kronecker coefficients g_{l,m,n} for length(m) <= 2, length(n) <= N, length(l) <= 2N for N=2,3,4.

In order to use this, you can open the jupyter notebook "KRONECKER_COMPUTER.ipynb" where there are instructions for how to compute Kronecker coefficients. 

This work is based on the paper "Estimating and computing Kronecker coefficients: a vector partition function approach" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12128), with [Marni Mishna]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/marnijulie)).
